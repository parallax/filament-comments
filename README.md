## Quickstart

### 1. Add model trait

First open the eloquent model you wish to add Filament Comments to.

```php
namespace App\Models;

use Parallax\FilamentComments\Models\Traits\HasFilamentComments;

class Product extends Model
{
    use HasFilamentComments;
}
```

### 2. Add comments to Filament Resource

There are 3 ways of using this plugin in your Filament Resources:

#### 1. Page actions

Open the page where you want the comments action to appear, this will most likely be the `ViewResource` page.

Add the `CommentsAction` to the `getHeaderActions()` method.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Filament\Resources\ProductResource\Pages;

use Parallax\FilamentComments\Actions\CommentsAction;

class ViewProduct extends ViewRecord
{
    protected function getHeaderActions(): array
    {
        return [
            CommentsAction::make(),
        ];
    }
}
```

You may customise the page action as you would any other action.

#### 2. Table actions

Open the resource where you want the comments table action to appear.

Add the `CommentsAction` to the `$table->actions()` method.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Filament\Resources;

use Parallax\FilamentComments\Tables\Actions\CommentsAction;

class ProductResource extends Resource
{
    public static function table(Table $table): Table
    {
        return $table
            ->actions([
                CommentsAction::make(),
            ]);
    }
}
```

You may customise the table action as you would any other action.

#### 3. Infolist entry

It's also possible to use the comments component within your infolist.

Add the `CommentsEntry` to the `$infolist->schema()` method.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Filament\Resources;

use Parallax\FilamentComments\Infolists\Components\CommentsEntry;

class ProductResource extends Resource
{
    public static function infolist(Infolist $infolist): Infolist
    {
        return $infolist
            ->schema([
                CommentsEntry::make('filament_comments'),
            ]);
    }
}
```

Please note that this cannot be used in combination with a comments action on the same page.

## Authorisation

By default, all users can view & create comments as well as only delete their own comments.

If you would like to change this behaviour you can create your own eloquent model policy for the `Parallax\FilamentComments\Models\FilamentComment` model.

You should define the policy class in the `filament-comments` config file.

```php
return [
    'model_policy' => \Parallax\FilamentComments\Policies\FilamentCommentPolicy::class,
];
```

## Pruning deleted comments

Comment records are set to be pruned after 30 days of being soft-deleted by default. You may change this value in the config file:

```php
return [
    'prune_after_days' => 30,
];
```

After configuring the model, you should schedule the `model:prune` Artisan command in your application's `Kernel` class. Don't forget to explicitly mention the `FilamentComment` class. You are free to choose the appropriate interval at which this command should be run:

```php
namespace App\Console;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Console\Kernel as ConsoleKernel;
use Parallax\FilamentComments\Models\FilamentComment;

class Kernel extends ConsoleKernel
{
    protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
    {
        $schedule->command('model:prune', [
            '--model' => [FilamentComment::class],
        ])->daily();
    
        // This will not work, as models in a package are not used by default
        // $schedule->command('model:prune')->daily();
    }
}
```

## Events

This package fires several events during its lifecycle:

- `CommentPosted`: Fired after a new comment is posted. The event object contains the comment instance.
- `CommentDeleted`: Fired after a comment is deleted. The event object contains the comment instance.

You can listen to these events in your application and define your own listeners to perform custom actions when these events occur.
